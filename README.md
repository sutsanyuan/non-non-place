‘non-non-place’ exhibition date｜2020 / 6 / 20 (sat) - 6 / 28 (sun) opening hours｜12:30 - 19:30 opening event｜2020 / 6 / 20 (sat) 16:00 venue｜Taiwan Contemporary Culture Lab C-LAB — Dormitory A The unique space of Dormitory A of Taiwan Contemporary Culture Lab C-LAB is the outcome of an experimental architectural programme, which had intended to merge indoor and outdoor spaces and was eventually transformed into a passageway structure. In this exhibition, 13 artists have rearranged the circumstances based on their own understanding and study of the current state of this obscure yet penetrating space where they named ‘non-non-place’. Their temporary inhabitation of the exhibition space shows the symbolic significance of the former military base C-LAB as a breakpoint within its temporal and spacial context, and how its historic body carries a mysteriously elaborate discipline in a delayed and detached manner.
